Wireshark Capture Summary (Anonymized)

Capture details:
- Interface: [redacted]
- Duration: ~60 seconds
- Actions: Visited a webpage, performed DNS lookups, ran ping tests (targets anonymized)

Protocols observed:
- DNS (UDP): Standard A-record queries and responses
- HTTP (TCP): GET requests and 200 OK responses (no sensitive content)
- TCP: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK sequences and occasional retransmissions
- ICMP: Echo request/reply for ping tests

Selected packet observations (anonymized):
1) DNS query -> response: Normal resolution for requested hostname.
2) TCP three-way handshake: SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK observed to establish connection.
3) HTTP GET: Browser requested page; response returned with typical headers.
4) ICMP echo/reply: Ping packets show round-trip times around X ms (redacted).

Recommendations:
- Use display filters (e.g., `dns`, `http`, `tcp`, `icmp`) to focus analysis.
- Avoid capturing sensitive payloads; redact when necessary.
- Investigate repeated retransmissions if persistent; may indicate network instability.
