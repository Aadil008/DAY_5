# Task 5 – Wireshark Packet Capture Analysis

This repository contains anonymized outputs for Task 5: capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify protocols such as DNS, HTTP, TCP, and ICMP. Analyze packet behavior and summarize findings.

## Files
- `task5_report_anonymized.pdf` → Full anonymized report.
- `wireshark_summary_anonymized.txt` → Summary of observed protocols and key packets.
- `capture_anonymized.pcap` → Placeholder anonymized pcap file (small sample/placeholder).
- `README_task5.md` → This file.

## Key Takeaways
- DNS resolution typically precedes HTTP connections.
- TCP three-way handshake is visible for connection establishment.
- Use filters to isolate protocols and redact sensitive data in captures.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark for capture and analysis.
- Basic network utilities (ping, browser) to generate traffic.
